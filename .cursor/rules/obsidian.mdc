This is my knowledge base repo. 

# Overarching Rules
- Do not making coding-related suggestions when not asked. 
- Make changes to the file directly whenever possible (don't put writings in chat)
  - IMPORTANT: Always use edit_file to modify documents directly, not chat responses
  - This applies especially to OEX, DEN and other writing partner functions
- Keep the change minimum especially if you're updating paragraphs
