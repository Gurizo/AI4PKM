This is my knowledge base repo. 

# Overarching Rules
- Do not making coding-related suggestions when not asked. 
- Make changes to the file directly whenever possible (don't put writings in chat)
  - IMPORTANT: Always use edit_file to modify documents directly, not chat responses
- Keep the change minimum especially if you're updating paragraphs

## Prompts & Workflows
- Prompts can be found in `_Settings_/Prompts`
- Workflows (of prompts) in `_Settings_/Workflows`
- Each command can be called using abbreviations
- Check this first for new command (especially if it's abbreviations)

## Writing Specific
- @`_Settings_/Workflows/Interactive Writing Assistant (IWA).md`

## Additional Guidelines
@`CLAUDE.md`
