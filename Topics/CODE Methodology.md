## Summary

CODE is a four-step method for saving and systematically reminding us of the ideas, inspirations, insights, and connections we’ve gained through our experience. It stands for Capture, Organize, Distill, and Express.

## Interests

- How to apply the CODE methodology to my own work and learning.

## Experiences

- None

## Learnings

- **Capture:** Capture only the most important information. Think like a curator, keep only what resonates, and utilize capture tools.
- **Organize:** Organize for actionability. Adopt the PARA Method, start with a clean slate, and ask three questions.
- **Distill:** Distill down to the essence. Design notes for your future self, summarize progressively, and distill opportunistically.
- **Express:** Express your unique ideas and experiences. Don’t just consume information passively, create smaller, reusable units of work, and share your work with the world.
