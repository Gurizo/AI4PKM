For the target note do the following:
- Update the note inline (don't create a new note)

## Improve Capture & Transcript
For long articles, chunk the contents first to avoid partial processing
1. Fix all grammar or transcript errors
   - Translate to Korean for Clippings
2. Add chapter (say, one per page)
   - Use heading3 (###)
3. Add formatting
   - Add lists (bullet point / numbered)
   - Highlight quotes to save in summary
	 - Limit to essence (say, one HL per chapter)
4. Otherwise keep existing prose
   - Overall length should be equal to the original 

## Add Summary for Thread
Summarize the article
- Add 'Summary' section at beginning using heading2 (##)
- For each main point, write a catchy summary with `Threads` sharing in mind
	- Would like to copy and paste into Thread
- Use quotes verbatim in your summary to convey the author's voice
	- Don't add highlight in summary

## Enrich using `Topics`
- Link related KB topics (only link to existing topics)
- Add one-line summary to relevant KB topics
- Also link to related summaries (e.g. books read over many days)
